This project utilizes MongoDB, beautiful soup, splinter, and pandas libraries in order to scrape text and full-resolution images of Martian hemispheres. The scraped materials are later displayed in a basic html website that offers mobile responsiveness. The scraping application is 'run' from the website through a button, but you need to start the app.py file first (and don't forget to start mongodb).
